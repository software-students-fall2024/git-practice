Article: [Why is it so hard to find entry-level software engineering jobs?](https://technical.ly/professional-development/why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-entry-level-software-engineering-jobs/)

I found this article interesting because I've been concerned about the difficulty of finding entry-level software engineering jobs, and this article gave some explanations for why they seem harder to find these days, such as due to overhiring in the pandemic followed by mass layoffs. The article also offered an optimistic view of finding entry-level jobs in the future, as shown through the decreasing average minimum experience required in these "entry-level" job listings. I also appreciated the tips the article gave for getting hired, like working on open source projects.


Tamara Bueno's Comment: I truly see how hard the market can be after computer science became over saturated over the years. I think swe roles will keep growing just that they will become more competitive.
