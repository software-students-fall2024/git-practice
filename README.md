## Interesting Part

I find this article interesting because it has helped me gain a clearer understanding of the role of software engineering. The article divides software engineers into different specializations, and each specialization has its own role and required skills.

I believe this article can help us consider the directions we might take if we want to pursue a career in this field. For instance, if someone is interested in CSS, they could consider becoming a Front-End Engineer. The article outlines the skills needed for this role, such as an understanding of responsive design and proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Overall, this is a great summary of software engineering.

## Comment - Reese Burns:
I also find this article very interesting as there a lot of different paths one can take as a software engineer. I personally find Front-End programming very fun as it's more of a visual process than Back-End. But I enjoy Back-End as you can see the manipulation and visualization of data through developing tables, charts, graphs, etc. I agree that this article is very helpful in the sense that it delves into each role and different types of software engineering roles that one can pursue.
