## [An article I find interesting: Forgotten Programming Languages](https://dev.to/idurar/unearthing-the-forgotten-lesser-known-and-unused-programming-languages-4fdn)

This article reviews some forgotten and lesser-known programming languages. As computer science students, we're only familiar with those that are taught in the classroom, like Java, Python, and C. This was an interesting read into exploring why some languages become obscured.

### 1. Befunge
Befunge is a unique esoteric programming language developed in 1993 and resembles a two-dimensional maze. Instead of code executing top-bottom, the instruction pointer "bounces off walls", resulting in often quirky behavior. Befunge has been unable to gain traction due to its steep learning curve.
```
>              v
v"Hello World!"<
>:v
^,_@

```
### 2. INTERCAL
INTERCAL, developed in 1972, was created as a parody of other programming languages. It utilizes unintuitive commands and syntax, that unsurprisingly, doesn't attract many users.

```
DO ,1 <- #13
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #238
DO ,1 SUB #2 <- #108
DO ,1 SUB #3 <- #112
DO ,1 SUB #4 <- #0
DO ,1 SUB #5 <- #64
DO ,1 SUB #6 <- #194
DO ,1 SUB #7 <- #48
PLEASE DO ,1 SUB #8 <- #22
DO ,1 SUB #9 <- #248
DO ,1 SUB #10 <- #168
DO ,1 SUB #11 <- #24
DO ,1 SUB #12 <- #16
DO ,1 SUB #13 <- #162
PLEASE READ OUT ,1
PLEASE GIVE UP
```
### 3. Malbolge
Malbolge is unreadable. It's essentially an enigma created in 1998, using an intricate execution model and cryptographic principles that make it hard to read and understand.

```
(=<`:9876Z4321UT.-Q+*)M'&%$H"!~}|Bzy?=|{z]KwZY44Eq0/{mlk**
hKs_dG5[m_BA{?-Y;;Vb'rR5431M}/.zHGwEDCBA@98\6543W10/`
```
### 4. Whitespace
Whitespace was developed in 2003 as a languaged based on spaces. The language only utilizes spaces, line breaks, and tabs, and not ideal for reading.
```
S S S T S S T   S S S L:Push_+1001000=72='H'_onto_the_stack
T   L
S S :Output_'H';_S S S T    T   S S T   S T L:Push_+1100101=101='e'_onto_the_stack
T   L
S S :Output_'e';_S S S T    T   S T T   S S L:+1101100=108='l'
T   L
S S S S S T T   S T T   S S L:+1101100=108='l'
T   L
```
### 5.  Piet
Piet is a visually inspired programming language developed in 2005. Programs are represented as abstract images. Despite being coloful and visually interesting, it offers little readability.      

## Julie Chen's Comment
This is an entertaining article that shows a more creative and playful side of programming! It is funny to see how there were established languages made for unpractical uses.

## Maddy Li's Comment
This article is very interesting and fun! I never think about how many programming languages exist but are never used- especially ones as unique and pointless as these.
