[The Tools of a Blind Programmer](https://www.parhamdoustdar.com/2016/04/03/tools-of-blind-programmer/)

<p> I find this article interesting because this shows how the methods one person uses to develop software may work for them but not for others. Each individual has to find the environment, setup and tools that work for them. Specifically, there are tools for people to help visualize their work process and flow of thought that can be more helpful to certain people than others. There is no absoulute correct aproach to development, and software engineering/ development is a form of creativity in itself. There are so many options and many tools out there to help people make software development an easier process. Finding the right tools that work for you and understanding them can be a challenge at first, but these tools are crucial to the development of your software. </p>

It was interesting to see the differences in accessibility in regards to the operating systems themselves, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It was insightful to hear that Linux, despite preconceived notions, may be one of the least accessible operating systems in terms of blindness accessibility, as its browsing capabilities are extremely limited as it is primarily based on a system of just reading text, and not to much on other necessary functions like browsers, browser access, etc. <p>
