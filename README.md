## 2. A paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article:

A software known as Google Ad Manager, owned by Google, has been receiving controversial backlash over selling private user information. Google Ad Manager is a tool used by websites around the world to sell ads. The technology conducts split-second auctions to place ads each time a user loads a page. During my summer internship at their main competitor, we referred to this process as autobidding.

This ongoing controversy over privacy issues has led Google to face a second antitrust trial with the federal court in less than a year. The article "U.S. Prepares to Challenge Google’s Online Ad Dominance" by David McCabe states, >"In August, a federal judge ruled in a separate case that Google had illegally maintained a monopoly in online search, a major victory for the Justice Department."< Federal regulators have also filed antitrust lawsuits against Apple, Amazon, and Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, claiming that those companies have similarly abused their power.

According to the article, Google’s ad-selling tools for publishers control 87 percent of the U.S. market, according to the government. The Justice Department says that, overall, Google’s technology for selling ads across the web brought in about $31.7 billion in 2021.

This is a very interesting topic, as Europe previously passed the Digital Services Act, enforcing privacy regulations. Now, the U.S. is beginning to raise concerns over privacy and a monopolized ad industry. If a privacy enforcement act is passed, could it lead to a series of events resulting in stronger privacy regulations in the United States? Worldwide?
