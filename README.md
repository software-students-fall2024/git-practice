# My Thoughts

The recent Microsoft and Quantinuum collaboration on creating 12 logical qubits and demonstrating a hybrid end-to-end chemistry simulation is particularly fascinating and highly relevant to my ongoing 3-qubit research at NYUAD. This development signifies a critical leap in quantum computing, highlighting the power of scaling up qubit systems while maintaining logical coherence and control. The achievement of 12 logical qubits isn’t just a technical milestone; it showcases the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches, which are becoming essential as we push the boundaries of what quantum systems can solve.

In my research, which focuses on 3-qubit models, the control and manipulation of fewer qubits allow us to deeply explore fundamental properties, interactions, and error mitigation techniques that are crucial for scaling up. Seeing Microsoft and Quantinuum successfully operate with 12 logical qubits provides valuable insights into how my current work can evolve and potentially integrate with larger, more complex quantum systems in the future. The demonstration of a hybrid end-to-end chemistry simulation emphasizes the practical applications of quantum computing in solving real-world problems—something that underpins the significance of all qubit research, whether it's at the 3-qubit level or the more advanced 12-qubit systems.

This progression aligns with my interests in exploring how logical qubits can enhance our understanding of complex phenomena, particularly in chemistry and physics, where accurate simulations of molecular structures are game-changers. The hybrid approach also underscores the importance of classical-quantum synergy, an area I find particularly intriguing as it mirrors the methods we are exploring to optimize and refine quantum operations on a smaller scale.

In essence, the strides made by Microsoft and Quantinuum offer a glimpse into the future of quantum research, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical applications. My work on 3-qubit systems at NYUAD feels like a foundational piece of this larger puzzle, contributing to the nuanced understanding necessary to support the next generation of quantum technologies. This article not only inspires but also provides a clear trajectory of how my current research might one day play a role in achieving similar breakthroughs.
